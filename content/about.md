I am a statistician at the Data Analytics Lab (DAL) at the University of Texas at El Paso. I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics and PhD in Computational Science from UTEP with dissertation on "Nonparametric Estimation of Elliptical Copulas". 

My working tasks are mostly about using classic statistical approaches to analyze research data from biology, public health, epidemiology, etc. Bio-medical data are my favorite type of data to work on because I like the rich insight they provide.

My research interests include statistical copulas, biostatistics, and Bayesian approaches, etc.
