      <description>Assumption is a common concept in statistical analysis, such as normality and homoscedasticity assumption for general linear models, proportional odds assumption for ordinal regression, proportional hazard assumption for cox regression.&#xA;Checking assumptions is different with making other statistical conclusions.&#xA;Firstly, assumptions hold as long as no evidence against them. We do not have to show evidence to support the assumptions. In stead, we only need to show that there is no obvious evidence against the assumptions.</description>

      <description>Sensitivity (True positive) Link to heading = Positive among all true&#xA;Sensitivity is for describing how sensitive a classifier or test is. Given a &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, the probability of spotting this &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; is called sensitivity. $$ \text{Sensitivity}=P(\text{positive}|\text{true}) $$ For example, a blood screening is used for spotting a disease. Sensitivity of the blood screening means the probability of getting a positive result when that person is actually sick. A very sensitive blood test will spot almost all sick people and even take healthy people as sick (low specificity).</description>
