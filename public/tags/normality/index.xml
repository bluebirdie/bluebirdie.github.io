      <description>Assumption is a common concept in statistical analysis. For example, we have normality assumption and homoscedasticity assumption in linear regression and ANOVA.&#xA;Checking assumptions is different with making other statistical conclusions.&#xA;Firstly, assumptions hold as long as no evidence against them. We do not have to show evidence to support the assumptions. In stead, we only need to show that there is no obvious evidence against the assumptions. To understand this, we may use an example in legal system.</description>
