      <description>Assumption is a common concept in statistical analysis, such as normality and homoscedasticity assumption for general linear models, proportional odds assumption for ordinal regression, proportional hazard assumption for cox regression.&#xA;Checking assumptions is different with making other statistical conclusions.&#xA;Firstly, assumptions hold as long as no evidence against them. We do not have to show evidence to support the assumptions. In stead, we only need to show that there is no obvious evidence against the assumptions.</description>
